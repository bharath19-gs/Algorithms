## Haskell 

**What is Haskell?**

[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) is a is a general-purpose, statically typed, purely functional programming language with type inference and lazy evaluation.[28][29] Designed for teaching, research and industrial application, Haskell has pioneered a number of advanced programming language features such as type classes, which enable type-safe operator overloading

So I started with my first  Pure Functional Programming language as Haskell for Co-design applications using tools like [ForSyDe](https://forsyde.github.io/).
